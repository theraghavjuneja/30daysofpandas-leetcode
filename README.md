# 30daysofpandas-leetcode
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<br>
Here, in this repo I will be adding the leetcode solution of 30 days of pandas with a .txt file where I have written how to approach this kind of code in pandas. Where and how to start thinking?
<h1>TIME-COMPLEXITY &SPACE COMPLEXITY</h1>
<br><p>
  Will keep on updating the code as soon as I progress and write a solution whose time-complexity is least and beats the 100%
