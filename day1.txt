LET'S FIRSTLY UNDERSTAND THE INITUTION USED IN THIS APPROACH
SO FIRSTLY THERE ARE 3 THINGS
THING-1
df.col_name >any_value  OR df["col_name"]>any_value
SO THIS STATEMENT WILL ACTUALLY RETURN U A SERIES /CONDITION FOR EACH COLUMN AS TRUE OR FALSE
This stmt tells whether this condition is met for any of the rows or not

THING-2
So, the 2nd thing here is 
df[df.col_name>anyvalue] OR df[df["col_name]>any_value]
SO THIS STATEMENTN WILL RETURN U THE DATA-FRAME WHICH MATCHES THE SERIES

SO THE THIRD THING HERE is
condition here is same which u can say series which i talked in thing-1
df[["col_1","col_2",,..nd so on]][condition]


so clubbed solution APPROACH
Firstly declaration of a variable named condition where I am checking the required condition
The condition is a series type thing
seconddly, giving this inside df to check the condition it has
