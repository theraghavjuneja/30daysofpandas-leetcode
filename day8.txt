This code can easily be done with the help of regex
1.) First of all get the mail_id series 
2.) Convert to str to apply regex
3.) Apply .match method
4. return users[users['mail'].str.match(r'^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_\.\-]*@leetcode(\?com)?\.com$')]
     r has been used as raw 
    ^ means starts with
    r'^[A-Za-z] This thing initially checks whether the thing is between a to z0{for the first letter}- it is mentioned that the prefix name must start with a letter
    [A-Za-z0-9_\.\-] THis code checks for the proceeding letters which could be any alphabete or name or certain characters
    \. is used since . is a special character so meta symbol"\" is used
    Now * means this can have one or more occurences
    @leetcode here means after all this has been checked the next occurences should be exactly matching with @leetcode
    and further characters matched the occurence(s) of .com 
    a dollar sign means end with
